## Introduction

Clear Mind Life is not a traditional CRUD application. It is a dual-engine architecture comprising **Clear Mind Life Identity** (Security/Identity) and **Clear Mind Life Triage** (Telehealth/Operations), entirely orchestrated by autonomous ReAct agents.

This guide outlines the critical infrastructure principles you must adhere to when building extensions or integrating Clear Mind Life into your clinical or security environments.

## The ReAct Architecture

At the core of Clear Mind Life is a unified ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agent design powered by the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. 

Unlike traditional APIs that require hardcoded if/else logic for every possible user action, the Clear Mind Life agent receives a high-level goal and autonomously selects the appropriate MCP servers to execute it. 

The `mcp_client_service.py` acts as the neural bridge. For example, if a user requests to "Schedule an MRI," the agent:
1. Calls the FHIR Schema translation MCP to locate the patient.
2. Calls the Insurance Verification MCP to check prior-authorization rules for that specific CPT code.
3. Calls the Calendar scheduling MCP to book the slot.

  Clear Mind Life allows you to plug in your own proprietary MCP servers. Ensure your servers conform to the standard `CallToolRequest` schema. Review our MCP integration guide to connect your internal databases.

## The HIPAA Compliance Boundary

In healthcare operations, feeding raw Patient Health Information (PHI) to LLM providers is a critical violation. Clear Mind Life Triage enforces a strict, programmatic HIPAA Compliance Boundary.

Before any data leaves the local Clear Mind Life execution environment to hit the cognitively reasoning agent layer, it passes through the `HIPAAFilter`.

- **Detection:** Regex masks and Named Entity Recognition (NER) identify diagnosis identifiers (e.g., "diabetes", "cancer"), medication names, and raw lab values.
- **Sanitization:** The data is transformed ("Patient has a diabetes appointment" becomes "Patient has an endocrinology appointment").
- **Execution:** The agent orchestrates the calendar tools using the sanitized string.

## Threat Model Matrix

Clear Mind Life Identity is designed to autonomously neutralize threats that bypass legacy static infrastructures. 

### 1. MFA Fatigue & Prompt Bombing
When an attacker spams a user's phone with MFA requests, legacy IdPs eventually grant access if the user clicks "Approve." Clear Mind Life Identity evaluates the contextual velocity of the requests. If 14 prompts occur in 5 minutes from an unfamiliar ASN, the agent invalidates the session token immediately, dropping the MFA fatigue success rate to zero.

### 2. Cross-Tenant IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
Clear Mind Life Identity does not rely on static JWTs for determining access rights. The agent validates every database query against the user's granular RBAC matrix in real-time, preventing lateral movement even if an API key is compromised.

## FHIR Schema Translation

To combat the $20 Billion lost annually to claims denials caused by intake paperwork errors, Clear Mind Life natively translates all unstructured clinical text into **FHIR R4 resources**.

When integrating Clear Mind Life Triage into your clinic, you do not need to adapt your doctors' raw notes. The Telehealth agent parses the audio/video transcript, extracts the chief complaint, validates the ICD-10 codes, and structures the entire encounter into a standard FHIR payload ready for the clearinghouse.

### Example: Validation Error

If an extension attempts to push invalid FHIR schemas, the ReAct agent will intercept it and throw a validation error before the database layer is hit:

```bash
{
  "message": "Schema Validation Failed",
  "code": "fhir_r4_compliance_error",
  "details": ["Missing required field: Patient.identifier"],
}
```

## Conclusion

By adhering to the ReAct agent paradigm and strictly respecting the HIPAA and Threat Model boundaries, you can use Clear Mind Life to automate highly complex, highly regulated operations.
