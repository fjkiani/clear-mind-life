## Beyond the Basics: High-Friction Orchestration

The Clear Mind Life Triage engine tackles 40 comprehensive clinical scenarios designed to severely test an AI agent's logic, reasoning, and adherence to medical standards. 

Rather than relying purely on external APIs (like OPA or GraphQL endpoints), Clear Mind Life's complexity stems from rigorously adhering to **FHIR R4**, **HL7 v2.x**, and **HIPAA** using basic MCP tools.

### Scenario: Multi-Channel Post-Discharge Coordination

When a patient is discharged (e.g., for a Congestive Heart Failure exacerbation), the clinical friction is enormous. Left unmanaged, readmission rates skyrocket. Clear Mind Life orchestrates the entire post-discharge perimeter autonomously.

Upon receiving the FHIR `Encounter` and `CarePlan` payload:

1.  **Scheduling:** Uses the `calendar` MCP to schedule a mandatory 7-day follow-up with the precise specialist (e.g., Neurology or Cardiology).
2.  **Document Generation:** Pipes the care plan instructions through the `pdf-generator` MCP, resulting in a HIPAA-compliant discharge summary.
3.  **Encrypted Dispatch:** Sends the PDF summary directly to the patient via the secure `email` MCP.
4.  **Medication Adherence:** Schedules sequenced, PHI-stripped medication reminders using the `sms-messaging` MCP.
5.  **Clinical Oversight:** Generates a check-in ticket in the `task-management` MCP for the care coordinator on Day 3.

  ],
  "check_in_task_created": {
    "assigned_to": "nurse_coordinator",
    "date": "2026-11-06"
  }
}
```

### Emitting Valid HL7 V2.x Logs
Every confirmed appointment triggers a legacy-compatible HL7 message payload for seamless EHR ingestion:
```hl7
MSH|^~\&|SCHEDULE|CLINIC|EMR|HOSPITAL|20261103120000||SIU^S12|123456|P|2.5
PID|1||MRN-12345||DOE^JOHN||19850315|M
SCH|1||||||Routine Office Visit|||||20261110140000
```

By constraining the agent to standardized schemas like FHIR and HL7, Clear Mind Life ensures deterministic outputs even when reasoning through heavily unstructured patient transcripts.
