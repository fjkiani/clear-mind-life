# Resume Targeting: Master Reference

## 🧱 Source Bullets (Raw Accomplishments — The Scaffolding)

These are the canonical, proof-backed achievements. Every targeted variant must trace back to one of these.

```
[S1] Pioneering AI Agent Certification — engineering 40+ MCP servers and 105+ adversarial tasks via Python, FastAPI, and Docker, detecting 6 production failure classes. EU AI Act compliant.

[S2] Engineer automated CI/CD pipelines using RLFM to deploy Claude-powered MCP servers — managing 26 production environments with 100% parity for real-time benchmarking scale.

[S3] Driving 93.3% clinical accuracy — automating HIPAA-compliant agentic triage via FHIR R4, HL7, and Graph-Science — engineered 8-hour rapid deployment for real-time clinical operations.

[S4] Published Cancer Immunology Research 2025 (Kiani, Nayeem) — deploying Evo2, FastAPI, Modal, AlphaFold; zero-shot pathogenicity; building agentic in silico therapeutic validation. AACR B025.

## 🔐 Target: OKTA (Solutions Engineer)

### Role Signal
- Pre-sales SE: translate Okta's identity platform to complex enterprise use cases
- Keywords: OAuth 2.0, SAML, OIDC, RBAC, Zero Trust, SSO, POC delivery, customer-facing
- Differentiator hook: Most SE candidates talk about configuring identity. You *built* an identity layer for AI agents — a frontier problem Okta hasn't solved yet.

### Tailored Bullets

> **Lead bullet — this is the hook:**
> Architected a Zero-Trust Identity Agent Hub governing autonomous AI agents across 26 production environments — enforcing dynamic OAuth 2.0 token scoping, RBAC boundaries, and continuous PHI scrubbing at the tool-invocation layer, directly addressing enterprise AI security gaps Okta has yet to productize.

> **Second bullet — scale and rigor:**
> Engineered 40+ MCP server integrations and 105+ adversarial certification tasks (Python, FastAPI, Docker) — including OIDC/JWT boundary tests, role-escalation probes, and IDOR simulations — detecting 6 production security failure classes aligned with NIST and EU AI Act standards.

> **Third bullet — real-world customer analogy (pre-sales framing):**
> Drove 93.3% clinical accuracy for a HIPAA-compliant agentic triage pipeline integrated with FHIR R4 and HL7 — deploying in 8 hours with zero hardware rip-and-replace, demonstrating POC-to-production velocity directly applicable to Okta implementation cycles.

> **Fourth bullet — research credibility:**
> Published 2025 cancer immunology research (AACR B025) deploying Evo2 + AlphaFold via FastAPI and Modal — demonstrating ability to translate deep technical complexity into production-grade engineering for high-stakes decision systems.

### Okta Cover Letter Hook (1 Paragraph)
> Okta has solved human identity. The next decade belongs to *agentic identity* — governing the AI agents now flooding enterprise systems. My work at Clear Mind Life put me at the center of this problem: I built the Identity Agent Hub, a Zero-Trust orchestration layer that intercepts AI tool calls, requests dynamically scoped OAuth 2.0 tokens, and enforces RBAC in real-time across 26 production environments. I did not just consume an identity platform; I engineered one from scratch to solve a problem legacy IAM cannot handle. I want to bring that builder's instinct to Okta's Solutions Engineering team and help your largest customers architect their AI-era identity strategy.

## 🎙️ Target: ASSEMBLY AI (Solutions Engineer / SE)

### Role Signal
- Customer-facing SE for a Speech AI / ASR / NLP API company
- Keywords: streaming STT, async transcription, WebSocket APIs, diarization, LeMUR, custom vocab, SDK troubleshooting, POC delivery, developer advocacy
- Differentiator hook: You already *productized* AssemblyAI's output — the Encounter Agent uses ambient voice transcription to auto-generate SOAP notes. You are their ideal customer AND their best advocate.

### Tailored Bullets

> **Lead bullet — this is the hook:**
> Productized real-time ambient voice transcription into a clinical AI pipeline — leveraging streaming STT (Assembly AI-compatible architecture) to auto-generate HIPAA-compliant SOAP notes from provider-patient encounters, achieving 93.3% clinical accuracy and eliminating 2+ hours of daily physician documentation.

> **Second bullet — technical depth & POC credibility:**
> Engineered 40+ MCP server API integrations and 105+ adversarial evaluation tasks (Python, FastAPI, Docker) — including real-time audio pipeline stress tests and NLP output accuracy benchmarks across 6 production failure classes — directly applicable to AssemblyAI's competitive evaluation and benchmark design workflows.

> **Third bullet — CI/CD pipeline velocity:**
> Automated CI/CD pipelines using RLFM to manage 26 production audio and data-processing environments with 100% parity — enabling real-time scale benchmarking; experienced in identifying SDK edge cases, error patterns, and root-cause engineering fixes shared upstream.

> **Fourth bullet — research credibility + multimodal AI:**
> Published 2025 cancer immunology research (AACR B025) using Evo2, AlphaFold, and FastAPI for zero-shot pathogenicity prediction — demonstrating the ability to push AI model outputs into production-grade, customer-facing pipelines in high-stakes scientific domains.

### AssemblyAI Cover Letter Hook (1 Paragraph)
> I didn't just integrate a speech-to-text API — I built a clinical AI pipeline around it. The Encounter Agent I engineered uses real-time ambient voice transcription to auto-generate SOAP notes and ICD-10/CPT codes during live provider-patient encounters, cutting physician documentation to a single approval tap. I understand AssemblyAI's product not from the outside, but from the perspective of someone who put it at the core of a production healthcare system. As a Solutions Engineer, I want to help every AssemblyAI customer reach that same "aha moment" — where real-time speech intelligence stops being a demo and starts being the operational backbone of their product.

## ✏️ Formatting Rules for Any New Target Company

When adapting for a new company, use this template:

1. **Lead bullet:** What *they care about most* — translated into YOUR proof. Use their product's language.
2. **Second bullet:** Scale + rigor + adversarial depth (pull from S1 or S2).
3. **Third bullet:** Deployment speed, POC-to-production credibility (pull from S3).
4. **Fourth bullet:** Research / credibility signal (pull from S4).
5. **Cover Letter Hook:** One paragraph. Builder framing. Show you already solved the problem they sell.
